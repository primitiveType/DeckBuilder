## Write text to a file via temp + rename so a crash mid-write never leaves
## the user's MCP config truncated. Creates the parent dir if needed and
## keeps a one-shot `.backup` of the prior file.
##
## On filesystems where rename-over-existing fails (Windows under AV / lock
## pressure, some SMB shares), falls back to overwrite-copy plus a
## backup-restore on failure. The original file is never removed before the
## new bytes are verified on disk — if both the rename and the copy fail,
## the user's prior config is restored from the `.backup` snapshot. See
## issue #297 finding #10 for the data-loss scenario this guards against.
