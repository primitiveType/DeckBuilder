class_name McpErrorCodes
extends RefCounted

## Error code constants shared across handlers. Mirrors protocol/errors.py.
##
## This `class_name` shipped in v2.3.2 and earlier and must stay reachable
## through self-update. v2.4.1 dropped it and triggered a "Could not resolve
## script" cascade for every user upgrading from any earlier version; v2.4.2
## restored it as a hot-fix. The cascade fires because Godot keeps stale
## registry entries during the disable -> extract -> enable window when a
## previously-registered class_name disappears, and that failure mode is
## independent of the runner's install ordering. See CLAUDE.md's
## never-delete-published-class_name policy for the shape-aware shim path
## that retirement (if ever needed) must follow.
##
## All consumers use the preload-alias pattern
## (`const ErrorCodes := preload(...)`) introduced in #412. The alias is
## stylistic; both `McpErrorCodes.X` and `ErrorCodes.X` resolve through the
## same Script object cache, so the alias is not a parse-safety boundary
## under the single-phase runner.

## #518: the play session is up (EditorInterface.is_playing_scene() is true, so
## editor_handler's EDITOR_NOT_READY "game is not running" gate already passed)
## but the game-side _mcp_game_helper autoload never registered its debugger
## capture within EVAL_READY_WAIT_SEC. Carved out of INTERNAL_ERROR so this
## boot-window / missing-autoload race stops masquerading as the opaque "eval
## hung" 10s timeout in telemetry — the same split #490 made for compile/runtime
## errors. NOT a hang: it fires fast (~3s) and is caller-actionable (let the game
## finish booting and retry, or check the autoload is enabled).
const EVAL_GAME_NOT_READY := "EVAL_GAME_NOT_READY"
## #518: the eval genuinely never finished inside the timeout ladder — the
## game-side 8s deadline aborted a hung await, or the editor-side 10s backstop
## fired because the game never replied at all (CPU-bound loop, frozen /
## backgrounded idle loop). Carved out of INTERNAL_ERROR — the last big
## still-unlabeled bucket from #487/#488 — so "your eval code never finished"
## stops reading as an internal fault in telemetry and agent-facing errors.
const EVAL_HUNG := "EVAL_HUNG"
## #518: the eval completed but its serialized result is too large for the
## debugger + WebSocket pipeline. Without this the reply is dropped silently
## (the debugger TCP peer discards messages over ~8 MiB) and the request rides
## to the 10s backstop as a phantom "hang". Failing fast game-side with the
## real byte count makes the failure actionable (return a smaller slice).

## audit-v2 #21 (issue #365): finer-grained codes carved out of the 471
## INVALID_PARAMS sites so agents can distinguish recoverable input
## errors from structural ones. INVALID_PARAMS stays for genuinely
## catch-all input errors that don't fit any of the buckets below.
##
## - NODE_NOT_FOUND: scene-tree/autoload node lookup failed (path didn't
##   resolve to a Node).
## - RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND: a `res://` path lookup failed (file/.tres/
##   .gdshader/.tscn etc. doesn't exist or couldn't load). Distinct from
##   NODE_NOT_FOUND because the recovery path differs — agents need to
##   know whether to fix a node path vs. create/import a resource.
## - PROPERTY_NOT_ON_CLASS: property/signal/method/uniform/slot lookup
##   failed on a known instance (path resolved, but the requested
##   member doesn't exist on that class).
## - VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE: numeric/index bound violation OR enum value
##   not in the allowed set.
## - WRONG_TYPE: input was a value (or a loaded resource) of the wrong
##   type — the param was provided, but `typeof` or `is X` failed.
## - MISSING_REQUIRED_PARAM: required input field was absent or empty.

## #651 stage 1: EDITOR_NOT_READY sub-codes. These travel in
## `error.data.sub_code`, NEVER as the top-level `error.code` — existing
## callers and dashboards key on EDITOR_NOT_READY, so the top-level code is
## frozen. Each sub-code names the concrete editor state at rejection time,
## limited to states EditorInterface/EditorFileSystem can report
## deterministically. States we cannot observe (script compilation,
## resource reload, modal dialogs) intentionally get NO sub-code: a bare
## EDITOR_NOT_READY stays the honest fallback rather than a guessed label.
## Keep in sync with protocol/errors.py::EditorNotReadySubCode — enforced
## by tests/unit/test_editor_not_ready_hint_contract.py.
